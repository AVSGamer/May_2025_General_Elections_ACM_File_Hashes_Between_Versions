Update: A lawyer claimed that the ACM Version in the Machines and Audited Version was mismatch with the records of what was "latest audited public information" at the time of his research(most likely...). Later the TEC announced that 3.5 was indeed audited. Makes you think why small discrepencies like this such as late announcements happen and what it does to public trust right?

The original files from the comelec website were the PDF files. I used the first free website service that popped up on search to convert the PDF into Microsoft Word document for easy textual content extraction.

It took me a while(the entire investagion on my end took 2 hours) due to the difference of the formatting of textual information. I had to reformat the files in terms of textual semantics so that they would match as much as possible then sorted every line of text in the files to ascending order so that any differences will be easy readable by text file comparator programs such as Visual Studio Code.

Compare the .txt files and see for yourself which files were altered.

I did the whole 2 hours process on my Facbook profile stream.

Feb. 18, 2026 - Since then I don't really remember when exactly the Facebook rule of livestream automated deletion after 30 days was implemented but I was aware of it through seeing the notification when it first came up on my Facebook account.
So I re-uploaded to YouTube as out of respect to Microsoft's GitHub's servers regarding this Video File:

Nevermind the errors in capitalization and spelling in the commit logs. You'd know that at one point and as far as I know that until now, usernames or LOGIN NAME (not password) are usually transformed to lower-case letters before being matched with the databse record when logging in. And right now I am doing this C.V. of mine to include this while unmedicated for like 4 days now, usually not that careless when it comes to final release versions. Just not really used with GitHub's every-commit-tracked in this context because I mistake the commit as the traditional "Save" function which I frequently use to avoid losing progress in text-edit-mode.
