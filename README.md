The original files from the comelec website were the PDF files. I used the first free website service that popped up on search to convert the PDF into Microsoft Word document for easy textual content extraction.

It took me a while(the entire investagion on my end took 2 hours) due to the difference of the formatting of textual information. I had to reformat the files in terms of textual semantics so that they would match as much as possible then sorted every line of text in the files to ascending order so that any differences will be easy readable by text file comparator programs such as Visual Studio Code.

Compare the .txt files and see for yourself which files were altered.

I did the whole 2 hours process on my Facbook profile stream.
